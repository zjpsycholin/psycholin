<h1 id="-welcome-to-introduction-to-psycholinguistics">🧠 Welcome to <em>Introduction to Psycholinguistics</em></h1>
<p>Language is one of the most fascinating and powerful tools humans possess — but how do we use it so effortlessly every day? How do infants go from babbling to fluent speech? Why do we sometimes struggle to find the right words, or stumble over sentences we&rsquo;ve said a hundred times before?</p>
<p>This course, <em>Introduction to Psycholinguistics</em>, invites you to explore the science behind language as a human cognitive ability. Together, we&rsquo;ll examine the processes that allow us to understand, produce, acquire, and mentally represent language.</p>
<p>Along the way, you&rsquo;ll encounter questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we recognize spoken words so quickly — even when people mumble or speak with an accent?</li>
<li>Can animals learn human language, or is language uniquely human?</li>
<li>What can language errors — like slips of the tongue — tell us about how our minds are organized?</li>
<li>Why do some people recover from brain damage and relearn language, while others don’t?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll dive into topics including speech perception, lexical access, sentence comprehension, discourse processing, bilingualism, non-literal language, and the brain systems that support communication.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-why-take-psycholinguistics">🧩 Why Take Psycholinguistics?</h2>
<p>Understanding how language works in the mind is not just for linguists. This course can open doors to fields such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cognitive science</strong>: How does language connect to thought?</li>
<li><strong>Language education</strong>: How do children and adults acquire new languages?</li>
<li><strong>Speech-language pathology</strong>: What happens when language breaks down?</li>
<li><strong>AI and language technology</strong>: How can machines mimic human language use?</li>
</ul>
<p>No prior background in linguistics or psychology is required — just curiosity and a willingness to think critically.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-a-few-fascinating-examples">✨ A Few Fascinating Examples</h2>
<p>Here’s a taste of the curious, often surprising discoveries we’ll explore together — all directly connected to topics in the course:</p>
<p>👶 <strong>Babies know more than they can say</strong><br>
Before they can speak, 6-month-old infants can already recognize their own name — and even pick it out from a noisy stream of speech. How do they do this with so little experience?<br>
<em>(Language development, Chapter 9)</em></p>
<p>🔄 <strong>Slip-ups aren&rsquo;t random — they’re windows into your mind</strong><br>
Ever said “You have hissed all my mystery lectures” instead of “missed all my history lectures”? That’s not just funny — it reveals how speech is planned ahead and prone to rule-based errors.<br>
<em>(Speech production, Chapter 2)</em></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Your brain predicts words before they arrive</strong><br>
When you hear “The boy went outside to fly a&hellip;”, your brain starts activating “kite” before it’s even said. But what if the sentence ends with “drone”? Welcome to predictive processing.<br>
<em>(Lexical access &amp; sentence processing, Chapters 3–4)</em></p>
<p>🧠 <strong>One patient could speak fluently&hellip; but made no sense</strong><br>
A man with Wernicke’s aphasia once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mother is away working her work out of here&hellip; I can&rsquo;t talk all of the things I do and part of the part I can go.”<br>
What’s happening when brain injury disrupts meaning, but not fluency?<br>
<em>(Aphasia and the brain, Chapter 13)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>🧭 <strong>Why do you change how you speak depending on who you’re talking to?</strong><br>
You might say “Could you possibly close the window?” to a professor but just “Shut it” to your roommate. That’s pragmatics in action — understanding meaning beyond the literal.<br>
<em>(Dialogue &amp; pragmatics, Chapter 8)</em></p>
<p>🧒 <strong>Kids say things they’ve never heard before — like “goed” and “runned”</strong><br>
These “errors” show that children aren’t just imitating adults. They’re building internal rules about how language works.<br>
<em>(Morphological development, Chapter 9)</em></p>
<p>👂 <strong>Why do you still hear the correct word even when people mumble?</strong><br>
Try saying “I scream” quickly — now say “ice cream.” Surprised how similar they sound? Your brain uses context to fill in the gaps.<br>
<em>(Speech perception, Chapter 2)</em></p>

<h2 id="-lets-get-started">📚 Let’s Get Started</h2>
<p>Over the next <strong>18 weeks</strong>, we’ll journey through the core areas of psycholinguistics using the textbook <em>Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science</em> by Matthew J. Traxler (1st edition). Each week includes <strong>two 45-minute sessions</strong>, combining conceptual depth with real data, interactive examples, and reflection.</p>
<p>This course is more than just facts and theories — it’s a window into <strong>how language makes us human</strong>.</p>
<p>So get ready to think, question, and discover — welcome aboard!</p>
