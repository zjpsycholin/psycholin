## 📘 Overview

In this session, we move beyond lexical access and focus on how the brain **represents**, **interprets**, and **resolves** word meanings. You’ll learn how context and experience shape the comprehension of ambiguous or polysemous words, and how neuroscientific methods help uncover the distributed nature of meaning representation in the brain.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Lexical Ambiguity

- Words can have:
  - **Homonyms**: two unrelated meanings (e.g., *bank*)
  - **Polysemes**: related meanings (e.g., *paper* as material or article)
- Ambiguity must be resolved quickly and often unconsciously during comprehension:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### Context Effects

- **Contextual cues** help the brain suppress irrelevant meanings.
- Example: “The fisherman sat on the river bank.” → *bank* = riverbank
- **Priming** experiments show faster responses when contextually appropriate meanings are activated.

---

### Semantic Priming

- When a word like “doctor” is processed faster after seeing “nurse” than “bread”.
- Priming reveals the **organization** of semantic memory: related meanings are **closely connected** in the mental lexicon:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Representation of Word Meaning

| Theory | Key Idea |
|--------|----------|
| **Semantic Feature Theory** | Words are represented by sets of semantic features (e.g., +ANIMATE, +TOOL) |
| **Prototype Theory** | Meaning is organized around a prototypical example |
| **Distributed Semantic Representations** | Meaning is spread over networks of shared features |

---

### Embodied & Distributed Views (Revisited)

- Meaning is **not localized** to one area; it is **distributed** across sensory, motor, and associative regions.
- E.g., reading “kick” activates **motor areas** in the leg-related cortex:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- Supported by fMRI studies and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) experiments.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Semantic Priming** | Faster processing of a word due to prior exposure to a semantically related word |
| **Lexical Ambiguity** | The condition of a word having multiple meanings |
| **Semantic Feature Theory** | Theory that meaning is composed of sets of defining features |
| **Distributed Representation** | Theory that meaning is encoded in patterns across brain networks |
| **Embodied Semantics** | Theory that meaning involves sensorimotor experiences in the brain |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🔍 Ambiguity Sorting

- Provide a list of ambiguous words.
- Students identify whether they are **homonyms** or **polysemes**.
- Discuss how context can disambiguate them.

### 🧪 Semantic Priming Demo

- Priming task: “bread–butter” vs. “bread–doctor”.
- Predict and explain differences in response time.

### 🧠 Brain and Meaning Activity

- Show neuroimaging data or brain diagrams from semantic studies.
- Discuss how different areas support **different semantic domains** (e.g., tools vs. emotions).

### ✍️ Sentence Completion Task

- Give ambiguous contexts:
  > “The ball was in the bank.”  
- Students provide disambiguating endings:
  > “… where it made a splash.” vs. “… guarded by a security camera.”

2. What is semantic priming, and how is it tested?
3. How do the theories of word meaning (e.g., features, prototypes, distributed models) differ?
4. What evidence supports the idea that word meaning is embodied or distributed?
5. How do homonyms and polysemes differ in how the brain processes them?

## 🧠 Chapter 5 Lecture Notes: Word Recognition and Lexical Access I

How do we recognize words so rapidly and accurately — even in noisy environments or unfamiliar voices? This chapter explores how listeners perceive speech and how the brain retrieves word meaning from the mental lexicon.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. The Challenge of Speech Perception

* **Speech signal**: rapid, continuous, and variable across speakers and contexts
* **Coarticulation**: speech sounds overlap, yet we still identify discrete words
* **Lack of invariance**: no single acoustic cue always corresponds to a specific phoneme

> 🧠 Despite variability, humans are highly efficient speech processors

> 🎧 **In class**: We’ll hear examples of ambiguous or coarticulated speech and identify what makes them hard to parse.

---

### 2. Segmentation and Word Boundaries

* No clear boundaries between spoken words in fluent speech
* **Segmentation cues**:

  * **Stress patterns** (e.g., English uses trochaic stress: “MOther,” “BAby”)
  * **Phonotactic probabilities**: likelihood of certain sound sequences (e.g., /ng/ never starts a word in English)
  * **Statistical learning**: tracking transitional probabilities between syllables (e.g., “pre-tty-ba-by”)

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: Infants as young as 8 months use statistical learning to identify word boundaries in a speech stream

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll try a brief segmentation demo using an artificial language stream.

---

### 3. The Mental Lexicon

#### Structure of the Lexicon

* **Lexical entries**: include word meaning, phonological form, syntactic category, morphological information
* Organized by:

  * **Frequency**: high-frequency words are recognized faster
  * **Neighborhood density**: number of similar-sounding words
  * **Semantic networks**: related meanings are linked

#### Accessing the Lexicon

* **Lexical access**: retrieving a word’s information during comprehension
* Influenced by bottom-up (sound) and top-down (contextual) cues

> 🔁 **Example**: In “He buttered the…” → likely access “toast” before “window” based on context

> 🧠 **In class**: We’ll map how word frequency and neighborhood density affect recognition.

---

### 4. Models of Spoken Word Recognition

* **Cohort Model**:

  * Word recognition starts from initial sounds (cohort)
  * Candidates are narrowed as more information comes in
* **TRACE Model**:

  * Interactive activation model
  * Includes competition between word candidates and top-down feedback

> 🎯 Both models explain different aspects of real-time word recognition

> 📊 **In class**: We’ll compare how the same input would be processed in the Cohort vs. TRACE model
