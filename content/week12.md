summary: "Introduces how infants acquire language from the womb to early word learning, covering phoneme perception, segmentation, and lexical development."

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore how language acquisition begins **before birth** and progresses rapidly through **infancy**. We examine how infants perceive speech sounds, solve the segmentation problem, and begin learning their first words—all with **minimal explicit instruction**.

---

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🍼 Prenatal Language Learning

- Fetuses respond to external auditory stimuli (e.g., mother's voice, native language prosody).
- Evidence: **High-amplitude sucking (HAS)** shows preference for stories heard in utero.

---

### 🔍 Speech Perception and Phoneme Categorization

- Infants perceive **phonemic contrasts** not present in their native language (universal perceivers).
- With exposure, perception becomes **language-specific** by 10–12 months.
- Tools: **Habituation** and **head-turn paradigms**.

---

### 🧩 Solving the Segmentation Problem

- Speech is **continuous**; no silences mark word boundaries.
- Infants rely on:
  - **Prosodic cues** (stress patterns)
  - **Phonotactic probabilities**
  - **Statistical learning** (tracking transitional probabilities between syllables)

---

### 🧠 Infant-Directed Speech (IDS)

- Features: Higher pitch, exaggerated intonation, slower rate.
- Helps attract attention and **highlight linguistic structure**.

---

### 🧠 Early Word Learning

- Infants map sounds to meaning via:
  - **Associationist learning**
  - **Cross-situational learning**
  - **Social cues** (e.g., gaze, joint attention)
- **Mutual exclusivity** and **whole object assumption** guide inferences.

## 🧪 Class Activities

### 👂 Infant Simulation: Syllable Stream Segmentation

- Play artificial language stream with hidden word boundaries.
- Students try to segment based on statistical probabilities.

### 🎧 Habituation Task Demo

- Show video/demo of infant habituation paradigm.
- Predict outcomes for phoneme discrimination.

### 💬 IDS Analysis

- Compare adult-directed and infant-directed speech.
- Group discussion: How does IDS support language learning?

## 🧠 Key Questions

1. What evidence suggests that language learning begins before birth?
2. Why are infants initially better than adults at distinguishing speech sounds?
3. How does statistical learning help infants discover word boundaries?
4. What roles do prosody and infant-directed speech play in early acquisition?

## 📝 Practice Prompt

> You are tasked with designing a study to determine whether infants can segment the word "pabu" from a stream of continuous syllables.  
> - What kind of cues would you expect them to rely on?  
> - What might you measure?
