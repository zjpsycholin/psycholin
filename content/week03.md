summary: "Explores how humans perceive speech despite variability in the signal, using behavioral and neurological evidence."

## 📘 Overview

Speech perception is a remarkable cognitive achievement: we can recognize spoken words rapidly and accurately, even though the signal is noisy, fast, and highly variable across speakers. This week, we explore how listeners parse the speech stream into discrete phonemes and words, how the brain supports these processes, and what speech illusions like the **McGurk effect** reveal about auditory-visual integration.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### The Speech Perception Challenge

- The **acoustic signal is continuous**, but we perceive **discrete phonemes**.
- Phoneme boundaries are often **blurred** due to **coarticulation**.
- There is **no simple one-to-one mapping** between sound and phoneme.

### Categorical Perception

- Listeners perceive sounds along a continuum (e.g., /b/ to /p/) as **distinct categories**.
- **Voice Onset Time (VOT)** is used to test this: e.g., /ba/ vs. /pa/
- Perception is **all-or-none**, not gradual.

### Coarticulation

- Sounds influence each other in speech (e.g., the /k/ in "key" vs. "cool").
- Listeners use **contextual cues** and **expectations** to resolve ambiguity:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

### Multimodal Integration & the McGurk Effect

- **McGurk Effect**: seeing [ga] + hearing [ba] = perceiving [da]
- Shows that speech perception integrates **visual** and **auditory** information.
- Demonstrates the **constructive nature** of perception.

### Theories of Speech Perception

| Theory | Core Idea |
|--------|-----------|
| **Motor Theory** | Speech perception involves accessing motor programs used for production. |
| **General Auditory Approach** | Listeners use general sound-processing mechanisms to perceive speech. |
| **Cohort Model (intro)** | Word recognition begins with a cohort of candidates, narrowed as more input arrives. |

### Neurological Evidence

- Brain imaging shows activity in **superior temporal gyrus** and **Broca’s/Wernicke’s areas** during speech perception.
- Studies of **brain-damaged patients** reveal that different parts of the brain handle **phonemic discrimination** and **comprehension**.

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Categorical Perception** | Perceiving sounds as belonging to distinct categories despite acoustic overlap |
| **Coarticulation** | Influence of surrounding sounds on the articulation of a phoneme |
| **McGurk Effect** | A perceptual illusion where visual and auditory inputs mismatch |
| **Voice Onset Time (VOT)** | The time between release of a consonant and onset of vocal cord vibration |
| **Motor Theory** | Theory that speech perception activates speech production mechanisms |
| **Phoneme Restoration** | The brain fills in missing phonemes based on context |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🎧 VOT Demonstration

- Students listen to a /ba/–/pa/ continuum.
- Discuss how they switch categories despite gradual changes.

### 🎥 McGurk Effect

- Play a video demo where the visual and auditory signals mismatch.
- Students report what they hear—often an illusory blend.
- Discuss how the brain integrates inputs.

### 🧠 Brain Tour (Mini Lecture + Discussion)

- Show diagrams of speech processing areas.
- Briefly compare brain areas involved in production vs. perception.

### 🔁 Perception Challenge

- Present coarticulated words out of context.
- Ask students to identify phonemes—then show how context changes perception.

## 🧠 Chapter 3 Lecture Notes: Language Acquisition I

How do children acquire language with such speed and accuracy, even before formal instruction? In this chapter, we explore the early stages of language development and theories that explain how humans acquire language.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. What Is Language Acquisition?

* **Language acquisition**: the process by which humans learn their native language(s)
* Involves phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics
* Begins *before birth* and continues into early childhood

> 🧠 **In class**: We’ll listen to early infant sounds and trace the developmental stages of speech.

---

### 2. Early Developmental Milestones

#### Prelinguistic Development

* **Prenatal**: fetuses respond to rhythm and intonation
* **0–6 months**: cooing, turn-taking, preference for native language sounds
* **6–12 months**: babbling (canonical and variegated), gesture use

#### First Words & Beyond

* **12 months**: first words typically emerge
* **18–24 months**: vocabulary explosion
* **Telegraphic speech**: early multi-word utterances (e.g., “want juice”)

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: By 6 months, infants can recognize their name and segment word boundaries using statistical cues.

> 🎧 **In class**: We’ll listen to babbling samples and discuss their diagnostic features.

---

### 3. Theoretical Approaches to Language Acquisition

#### Nativist Theories (Chomsky)

* **Universal Grammar (UG)**: humans are born with innate language principles
* Language input triggers parameter setting
* Poverty of the Stimulus argument: input is insufficient; knowledge must be innate

#### Empiricist Theories (Behaviorist & Connectionist)

* Learning occurs through **association, imitation, reinforcement**
* Connectionist models: neural networks learn through exposure

#### Interactionist Theories

* Emphasize social interaction and **input richness**
* **Child-Directed Speech (CDS)**: exaggerated intonation, slower tempo, simplified structure

> 👶 **Cross-linguistic Note**: CDS appears universally, but its features vary by culture and language.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll evaluate what each theory explains well and where it falls short.

---

### 4. The Role of Input and Environment

* Children need **exposure** to language in meaningful contexts
* Quality of input affects acquisition speed and vocabulary growth
* Deaf children not exposed to sign develop *home signs*, showing drive for communication

> 🧠 Language acquisition is resilient but shaped by input: children invent systems when needed, yet benefit from rich exposure.
