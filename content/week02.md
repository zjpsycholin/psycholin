## üìò Overview

This week explores how we plan speech before articulation. You‚Äôll learn about the stages between intention and utterance, and how **speech errors** and **TOT states** reveal the underlying architecture of our language production system. We discuss key models of speech planning, including **spreading activation** and **lemma theory**, and look at how naming tasks and interference paradigms are used to investigate production.

---

## üß† Core Concepts

### Stages of Speech Production

1. **Conceptualization**: forming a preverbal message
2. **Formulation**: converting concepts to linguistic structure
   - Lexical selection (choosing lemmas)
   - Morphological encoding
   - Phonological encoding
3. **Articulation**: sending instructions to motor systems
4. **Self-monitoring**: internal checking for errors

### Evidence from Speech Errors

- Speech errors are **systematic** and reflect real mental planning (not random).
- Types include:
  - **Anticipations**: ‚Äúbake my bike‚Äù (take my bike)
  - **Perseverations**: ‚Äúbeef needle‚Äù (beef noodle)
  - **Blends**: ‚Äúshout + yell = shell‚Äù
  - **Swaps**: ‚Äúyou have hissed all my mystery lectures‚Äù
- These suggest distinct **levels of planning**: semantic, lexical, phonological.

### Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) States

- You know the meaning, maybe the initial sound or number of syllables, but can‚Äôt retrieve the full word.
- TOTs show separation between **lemma** (meaning/syntax) and **lexeme** (phonological form):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

### Spreading Activation Model

- Words are stored in networks.
- Activation of one concept **spreads** to related nodes.
- Errors occur when activation spreads to a competing item (e.g., ‚Äúcat‚Äù activates ‚Äúdog‚Äù).
- Explains **semantic and phonological** errors, priming effects, and lexical interference:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Lemma Theory

- Distinguishes between:
  - **Lemma**: abstract representation with syntactic and semantic information.
  - **Lexeme**: actual form used in articulation.
- Speech errors and TOTs support this split:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## üè∑Ô∏è Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Speech error** | A slip of the tongue that reveals structure in planning (e.g., blend, anticipation) |
| **Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT)** | A temporary failure to access a known word |
| **Lemma** | An abstract representation of a word's syntactic and semantic features |
| **Lexeme** | The phonological form of a word |
| **Spreading Activation** | A model where related items in memory become active through associative links |

## üß™ Examples & In-Class Activities

### üó£Ô∏è Speech Error Collection

- Students collect or share examples of real-life slips.
- Classify them: semantic, phonological, morphological.

### üí¨ TOT Sharing

- Students describe a recent TOT experience.
- What did they recall (initial sound, number of syllables)?
- Relate this to lemma/lexeme distinction.

### üé® Picture Naming Demo

- Show picture-word interference tasks (e.g., naming a picture of a cat while ‚Äúdog‚Äù is presented).
- Discuss how competition in lexical access occurs.

### üß™ Error Diagnosis Challenge

- Provide anonymized transcripts with speech errors.
- Students identify the type of error and theorize its source in the production system.

## ‚ùì Self-Check Questions

1. What types of evidence do speech errors provide about the stages of production?
2. How do TOT experiences support the distinction between lemmas and lexemes?
3. What are the key assumptions of the spreading activation model?
4. How can we design experiments to test lexical access or interference?

## üß† Chapter 2 Lecture Notes: Origins of Human Language

Where did language come from? Was it a sudden evolutionary leap or the gradual outcome of cognitive and social changes? In this chapter, we explore major theories about the biological and cultural origins of human language and the factors that set it apart from other species‚Äô communication systems.

---

## üìò Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. Why Study Language Origins?

* Understanding language origins helps explain *why* language is the way it is.
* The origins of language remain speculative but are informed by data from archaeology, anthropology, genetics, and neuroscience.

> üß© **In class**: We‚Äôll reflect on why language origin studies are challenging and what kinds of evidence count.

---

### 2. Biological Foundations of Language

#### Neurological Basis

* **Broca‚Äôs area**: associated with speech production
* **Wernicke‚Äôs area**: involved in comprehension
* Language relies on *distributed* brain systems, not a single ‚Äúlanguage center.‚Äù

#### Genetic Basis

* **FOXP2 gene**: linked to language development
* Mutations in FOXP2 can result in deficits in speech and grammar

> üîç **Research Spotlight**: FOXP2 mutations in the KE family revealed strong genetic influence on articulation and grammar, but not on general intelligence.

#### Anatomical Evidence

* **Vocal tract**: Human vocal tract shape supports a wide range of speech sounds
* **Larynx position**: Lower in humans than in apes, allowing complex vocal articulation

> üß† **In class**: We‚Äôll review diagrams comparing vocal tract anatomy in humans and chimpanzees.

---

### 3. Evolutionary Hypotheses

#### Continuity vs. Discontinuity

* **Continuity hypothesis**: Language evolved gradually from pre-linguistic communication systems
* **Discontinuity hypothesis**: Language is a qualitatively different capacity that appeared suddenly

#### Gesture-First Hypothesis

* Language may have started as a **gestural** system before becoming vocal
* Supported by evidence from sign languages and mirror neurons

> üñêÔ∏è **Cross-modal Evidence**: Sign languages have all the properties of spoken language (syntax, recursion, productivity)

#### Social and Cognitive Factors

* The rise of **symbolic thought**, **group cooperation**, and **theory of mind** likely played a role
* Language evolution may be tied to **cultural transmission** and **shared intentionality**

> üß™ **In class**: We‚Äôll evaluate which evidence supports each hypothesis and what open questions remain.

### 4. What Makes Human Language Unique?

| Feature               | Human Language                    | Animal Communication   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Syntax                | Present (recursive, hierarchical) | Absent or very limited |
| Displacement          | Yes                               | Rare or absent         |
| Cultural Transmission | Strong                            | Weak to moderate       |
| Productivity          | Infinite                          | Finite                 |
| Symbolic Use          | Arbitrary symbols                 | Often iconic or fixed  |

> üé¨ **In class**: We‚Äôll revisit animal studies (Kanzi, vervet monkeys) and assess whether they show true linguistic capacity.
