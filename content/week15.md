tags: ["sign language", "modality", "neural basis", "language acquisition"]
summary: "Explores the structure, processing, acquisition, and neural basis of sign languages, emphasizing their similarities and differences with spoken language."

## 📘 Overview

This week we examine sign languages as fully expressive natural languages. We discuss their phonological, morphological, and syntactic structures; how they are processed in the brain; and how they are acquired. We also explore cognitive consequences of deafness, the role of the right hemisphere, and issues related to cochlear implants.

## 🧠 Core Topics

### ✋ Characteristics of Signed Languages

- Sign languages have **phonological parameters** (handshape, location, movement).
- They exhibit **morphological complexity**, including rich inflectional morphology.
- Syntax in signed languages includes **word order variation** and **use of space for grammatical relations**.

### 🧠 Lexical Access and Processing

- Signers exhibit similar effects as spoken language users in **lexical access** (e.g., frequency, neighborhood density).
- **Priming** effects and real-time processing are evident in ERP and reaction time studies.

### 👶 Language Acquisition and Evolution

- Deaf children exposed to sign language from birth acquire it on a similar timetable as spoken languages.
- Sign language use sheds light on **language evolution** through gesture.

### 📖 Reading in Deaf Signers

- Reading outcomes depend on **early language exposure**.
- Proficiency in sign language correlates positively with **reading ability**.

### 🧠 Neural Basis of Sign Language

- Sign language is **left-lateralized**, much like spoken language.
- **Right hemisphere** contributes to processing **spatial and visual features**.
- fMRI and lesion studies show activation in traditional **Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas**.

### 🎧 Cochlear Implants

- Implants restore partial hearing but outcomes vary:
  - Early implantation leads to better results.
  - Language input before implantation matters.
- Language development after CI use differs depending on **prior sign language use**.

## ❓ Key Questions

1. How does sign language compare structurally and cognitively to spoken language?
2. What brain regions are involved in sign language processing?
3. How do deaf children acquire sign language, and how does it affect reading development?
4. What are the implications of cochlear implants for language development?

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🧏 Sign Language Video Analysis

- Watch clips of native signers (ASL, BSL, CSL).
- Identify morphological markers and syntactic structure.
- Discuss how information is spatially represented.

### 🧠 Lateralization Mapping

- Examine brain imaging studies comparing signers and speakers.
- Match language functions to neural regions.

### 🎭 Gesture Communication Game

- Students use only gesture to describe actions or concepts.
- Reflect on expressiveness and limitations of visual modality.
