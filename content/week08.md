summary: "Examines how readers generate inferences to build coherent situation models, including bridging, elaborative, and predictive processes during discourse comprehension."

## 📘 Overview

This week continues our exploration of discourse processing, with a special focus on how we use **inference** to connect and enrich the information conveyed across sentences. We explore key types of inferences—**bridging**, **elaborative**, and **predictive**—and the cognitive and neural mechanisms that support their generation during reading and listening.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Are Inferences?

- Inferences are **unstated connections or conclusions** drawn by the reader to construct a **coherent mental representation**.
- Readers and listeners go beyond literal input to **fill in gaps**, **explain causal links**, and **anticipate outcomes**.

---

### Bridging Inferences (Backward)

- Needed to **maintain coherence** when connections are implicit.
- Example:
  > “The vase fell. Sarah swept up the pieces.”
  - Inference: The vase broke.
- These are **memory-based** and often automatic.

---

### Elaborative Inferences (Forward)

- Add **new, plausible information** beyond what’s stated.
- Example:
  > “The actress stepped onto the stage.” → She might perform or speak.
- These depend on **goals**, **schemas**, and **world knowledge**.
- Can be **optional** and variable across readers.

---

### Predictive Inferences

- Readers often anticipate **what will come next**.
- Example:
  > “The storm clouds gathered...” → Rain is likely.
- The **strength** of predictive inferences depends on context and individual differences.

---

### Memory and Updating

- **Situation models** are updated as new information arrives.
- Inferences can guide **activation**, **integration**, and **suppression** processes.
- Updating involves deciding whether new input **modifies**, **adds to**, or **replaces** previous info.

---

### Brain and Inference Generation

- Neuroimaging studies show:
  - **Medial prefrontal cortex** supports situation updating.
  - **Right hemisphere** often recruited for making global coherence inferences.
- Patients with brain injury often struggle with **bridging and elaborative** inference tasks:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Inference** | A mental process of deriving unstated conclusions or connections |
| **Bridging Inference** | Inference that connects a new sentence to previous discourse |
| **Elaborative Inference** | Inference that enriches the situation model with unstated but plausible information |
| **Predictive Inference** | Expectation about upcoming content based on prior context |
| **Situation Model Updating** | The revision of mental representations as discourse unfolds |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🔄 Inference Generation Challenge

- Provide students with short texts missing an explicit link (e.g., cause/effect).
- Ask: “What must be true for this story to make sense?”

### 🧠 Bridging vs. Elaborative Sorting Task

- Given 10 example inferences, students classify them as **bridging**, **elaborative**, or **predictive**.

### 📖 Contextual Prediction Game

- Pause after a context sentence.
- Students write down what they think comes next.
- Compare against actual continuation and reflect.

## ❓ Self-Check Questions

1. What is the difference between bridging and elaborative inferences?
2. How do situation models change as we receive new input?
3. What kinds of information support predictive inferences?
4. How does the brain contribute to inference generation?
5. Can all inferences be controlled? Are they always useful?

## 🧩 Practice Prompt (Adapted)

> Read the sentence:  
> “The engine sputtered, and the car rolled to a stop.”  
> - What inferences can you draw about what happened?  
> - What types of inferences are these, and how do they support comprehension?
