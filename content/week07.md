## 📘 Overview

This week focuses on **discourse-level comprehension**: how we go from understanding isolated sentences to constructing **integrated mental models** of entire narratives or conversations. You'll learn three influential models—**Construction-Integration**, **Structure Building**, and **Event Indexing**—and examine how knowledge, memory, and coherence contribute to understanding stories and discourse.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is Discourse Processing?

- Involves understanding **connected text** or conversation, not just isolated sentences.
- Requires building a **situation model**: a mental simulation of the events described.

---

### Model 1: Construction–Integration Theory

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Construction** | Generate all possible meanings (including irrelevant or contradictory ones). |
| **Integration** | Use context and prior knowledge to suppress irrelevant meanings and **integrate** consistent ideas. |

- Influenced by **spreading activation** and **network models**.
- Highlights importance of **text coherence** and **prior knowledge** in reducing ambiguity.

---

### Model 2: Structure Building Framework

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Laying a Foundation** | Readers begin building a representation when they encounter a new topic or idea. |
| **Mapping** | New info is integrated if related to the current structure. |
| **Shifting** | If unrelated, a **new substructure** is created (topic shift, tense change, etc.).

- **Enhancement** strengthens relevant nodes; **suppression** reduces activation of unrelated ideas:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### Model 3: Event Indexing Model

- Readers track **5 key dimensions** to understand a situation:

| Dimension | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Time** | Do events occur at the same time? |
| **Space** | Are characters in the same location? |
| **Entity** | Are the same people or objects involved? |
| **Causality** | Are events causally linked? |
| **Intentionality** | Are goals or motivations shared? |

- **Similarity across dimensions** helps maintain coherence and facilitates comprehension:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Causal and Coherence Inference

- We use **background knowledge** and **semantic cues** to make inferences:
  - Temporal ordering
  - Cause-effect relationships
  - Goal fulfillment
- **Bridging inferences**: connect sentences across gaps.
- **Elaborative inferences**: enrich the model with relevant but unstated info.

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Discourse** | Connected sequences of language (text or talk) |
| **Situation Model** | Mental representation of what a discourse describes |
| **Construction-Integration Model** | Framework describing how meanings are initially constructed and then refined |
| **Structure Building** | A model of comprehension involving foundation, mapping, and shifting |
| **Event Indexing** | Model focusing on dimensions tracked during discourse understanding |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🔁 Coherence Building Challenge

- Present scrambled story events (e.g., “She cried. He left. They fought.”).
- Students reorder and justify the most **coherent** narrative.

### 📚 Story Retelling

- Read a short paragraph aloud.
- In pairs, students retell the story to a peer from memory.
- Discuss what parts were emphasized, omitted, or inferred.

### 🧩 Event Indexing Game

- Provide mini-stories that vary one event dimension (e.g., space or causality).
- Ask students which version would be harder to follow and why.

## 🧠 Practice Prompt (Adapted)

> Read the following two-sentence discourse:  
> “Jason dropped the vase. The floor was wet.”  
> - What kind of inference do you need to make to understand this connection?  
> - Which model(s) of discourse processing best explain this?
