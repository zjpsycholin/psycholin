summary: "Introduces the mental representation of words and models of lexical access, including semantic networks and embodied accounts."

## 📘 Overview

This week focuses on how words are **represented**, **stored**, and **retrieved** in the mind. We examine various models of the **mental lexicon**, how meaning is structured, and how the mind retrieves lexical items efficiently. You’ll learn about traditional **associationist theories**, the **symbol grounding problem**, and **embodied semantics**, as well as first- to third-generation computational models.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is a Word?

- Psycholinguists distinguish between:
  - **Lexeme**: the form of the word (e.g., “run,” “ran,” “runs”)
  - **Lemma**: an abstract entry in the lexicon with semantic/syntactic info
- Words have **semantic**, **syntactic**, and **phonological** properties that are processed in different stages.

---

### Lexical Semantics

- Focuses on how word meanings are **represented and structured** in memory.
- Words are **linked by meaning, context, and usage** (e.g., “dog” → “bark”, “bone”).

---

### Associationist Models

- **HAL (Hyperspace Analogue to Language)** and **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)** represent meaning based on **co-occurrence** in language.
- Meaning is derived from **distributional patterns** across contexts:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- These models help explain **priming effects**, **semantic distance**, and **category structure**.

---

### The Symbol Grounding Problem

- How do symbols (e.g., words) connect to real-world experiences?
- Purely symbolic models (like HAL/LSA) struggle to explain **how symbols acquire meaning**.

---

### Embodied Semantics

- Suggests meanings are grounded in **sensorimotor experiences**.
- E.g., understanding “kick” involves partial activation of brain areas associated with **motor planning for the legs**.
- Supported by neuroimaging studies showing **motor cortex involvement** in language comprehension:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Lexical Access Models

| Generation | Features |
|------------|----------|
| **First** | Serial search models: words are retrieved by scanning a list of candidates (like dictionary lookup) |
| **Second** | Frequency-based access: high-frequency words are accessed faster (logogen model) |
| **Third** | Distributed models: words are activated in **parallel**, with activation levels depending on frequency and context |

- Third-generation models combine features from earlier approaches and handle **ambiguity, priming, and prediction** better:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Lexeme** | The morphological/phonological form of a word |
| **Lemma** | A mental representation of a word's syntactic and semantic information |
| **Associationist Model** | Theories that represent meaning via word co-occurrence and proximity in vector space |
| **Symbol Grounding Problem** | The challenge of linking abstract symbols to real-world referents |
| **Embodied Semantics** | The view that meaning is grounded in sensory and motor systems |
| **Lexical Access** | The process of retrieving a word from memory during comprehension or production |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🧠 Word Web Brainstorm

- Given a target word (e.g., “apple”), students quickly generate related words.
- Use to demonstrate **semantic networks** and **priming**.

### 🖼️ HAL vs. Embodiment Demo

- Students sort words by co-occurrence (text-based) vs. experience (sensorimotor).
- Discussion: what’s missing from co-occurrence models?

### 💬 Priming Reaction Task

- Present pairs like “doctor–nurse” and “bread–nurse.”
- Measure how semantic relatedness speeds up response time.

### 🧪 Lexical Access Simulation

- Simulate lexical activation using cards or diagrams:
  - “cat” activates “dog,” “fur,” “meow,” etc.
  - Show how **frequency**, **context**, and **ambiguity** shape activation.

## ❓ Self-Check Questions

1. What is the difference between a lemma and a lexeme?
2. How do HAL and LSA models explain word meaning?
3. What is the symbol grounding problem, and how do embodied accounts address it?
4. Compare first-, second-, and third-generation models of lexical access.
5. How does context influence which meaning of an ambiguous word is accessed?

## 🧩 Practice Prompt (Adapted from the Textbook)

> Design a small-scale experiment to test the effects of word frequency on lexical access speed.  
> - What method would you use?  
> - What results would support a frequency-based model?  
> - How might priming or context alter your findings?

## 🧠 Chapter 4 Lecture Notes: Language Acquisition II

In this chapter, we explore the development of more complex linguistic structures in children’s speech — especially grammar, morphology, and syntax. We also examine what overregularization errors and bilingual development can reveal about the nature of language learning.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. Grammatical Development

* Children move from two-word combinations to more structured utterances
* **Syntactic bootstrapping**: using sentence structure to infer word meaning
* Early word order patterns show awareness of grammar (e.g., “Mommy sock” = “Mommy has a sock” or “Put the sock on Mommy”)

> 📈 Children’s utterances gradually become more adult-like but reflect creative rule-building

> 🧠 **In class**: We’ll trace the growth of sentence length and complexity using transcript examples.

---

### 2. Morphological Development

#### Inflectional Morphology

* Regular past tense: “walked,” “played”
* Irregular forms: “went,” “broke”

> 🧩 **Overregularization**:
>
> * Children apply regular rules to irregular verbs (e.g., “goed,” “runned”)
> * Evidence that children internalize rules, not just imitate

#### Derivational Morphology

* Forming new words from existing ones (e.g., “teacher” from “teach”)
* Acquired later than inflectional morphology

> 🎧 **In class**: We’ll listen to recordings of overregularization and discuss what they reveal about internal rule systems.

---

### 3. Negative and Question Formation

* Children begin by placing negation at sentence edges (e.g., “No go outside”)
* Question development:

  * Stage 1: Rising intonation only (“You want juice?”)
  * Stage 2: Use of auxiliaries and inversion (“Can I go?”)

> 🧠 Errors like “Why she can’t go?” are systematic and reflect transitional grammar stages.

---

### 4. Bilingual Language Acquisition

* Simultaneous bilingualism: acquiring two languages from birth
* Sequential bilingualism: learning a second language after establishing the first
* Children often code-switch — combine elements from both languages — but do so systematically

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: Bilingual infants can separate languages by rhythm and intonation before they can speak.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll analyze bilingual transcripts and examine code-switching patterns.

---

### 5. Input, Feedback, and the Role of Caregivers

* Caregivers rarely correct grammar directly — but they provide feedback through recasts (reformulations)
* **Implicit correction**: “Her goed to the store” → “Yes, she went to the store.”
* Quantity and quality of input shape grammatical development
