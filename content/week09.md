## 📘 Overview

This week introduces one of the most fundamental processes in discourse comprehension: resolving **reference**. Whether it's identifying who “she” refers to or which object “that” indicates, listeners and readers must rapidly and accurately map **anaphoric expressions** to the correct **referents**. We'll examine **linguistic cues**, **working memory**, and theoretical models like **Binding Theory**, **Centering Theory**, and the **Informational Load Hypothesis**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is Reference?

- **Referents** are entities introduced or assumed in discourse.
- **Anaphora** refers to expressions (e.g., pronouns) that depend on a previously introduced referent.

### Characteristics That Aid Co-Reference

#### Of Referents:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Recency** | Recently mentioned referents are more accessible. |
| **Grammatical role** | Subjects are more likely referents. |
| **First mention** | Entities introduced early in a sentence are favored. |
| **Discourse focus** | Salient or topical entities are more accessible:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

#### Of Anaphors:

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Definiteness** | “The man” vs. “a man” guides expectations. |
| **Syntactic position** | Embedded vs. main-clause anaphors vary in processing ease. |
| **Ambiguity** | Ambiguous pronouns (e.g., “he” in male-dense contexts) increase difficulty:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Linguistic Theories of Reference

#### Binding Theory

- A syntactic theory from generative grammar:
  - **Principle A**: Reflexives must refer to a subject in the same clause.
  - **Principle B**: Pronouns cannot refer to a subject in the same clause.
  - **Principle C**: Names cannot be coreferential with a pronoun that precedes them.

#### Psycholinguistic Models

| Model | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Memory Focus Model** | Refers to the accessibility of referents held in working memory. |
| **Centering Theory** | Suggests that discourse coherence is maintained by linking current utterances to salient prior “centers.” |
| **Informational Load Hypothesis** | Proposes that pronoun interpretation is easiest when memory demands are low and discourse is simple:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Reference** | The act of pointing to or identifying an entity in discourse |
| **Anaphor** | A word (like “she” or “it”) that refers back to a previously mentioned item |
| **Co-reference** | The relationship between a referring expression and its antecedent |
| **Binding Theory** | A theory of syntactic constraints on reference |
| **Centering Theory** | A discourse model that explains focus and referent selection based on coherence |
| **Informational Load Hypothesis** | A theory explaining pronoun processing difficulty based on memory and sentence complexity |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🔍 Pronoun Puzzle Game

- Show short sentences with multiple characters (e.g., “John hugged Mike. He smiled.”)
- Students must infer who “he” refers to and explain their reasoning.

### 📖 Binding Theory Test

- Provide sentence pairs and ask whether the reference is acceptable:
  - “Mary saw herself in the mirror.” ✅
  - “Herself saw Mary in the mirror.” ❌
- Discuss each Binding Principle with examples.

### 🧠 Co-reference Matching Task

- Present mini-stories with pronouns and noun phrases.
- Students draw arrows or diagrams linking referents.

## 🧩 Practice Prompt (Adapted)

> Sentence: “Laura told Jenny that she had won the award.”
> - Who could “she” refer to?
> - What contextual or structural information might disambiguate the reference?
