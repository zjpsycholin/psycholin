## 📘 Overview

Psycholinguistics is the scientific study of the mental mechanisms that make language possible. This week introduces the field by exploring its scope, questions, and why language—something seemingly effortless in daily life—is actually an incredibly complex human ability. We examine what psycholinguists study, how they study it, and what kinds of questions guide their research.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is Psycholinguistics?

- Psycholinguistics = psychology + linguistics.
- It studies how humans **produce**, **comprehend**, **acquire**, and **represent** language mentally.

### Why Study Language Scientifically?

- Language feels natural but is **cognitively complex**.
- Language processing happens **rapidly and unconsciously**, which makes it a great window into how the mind works.
- The **scientific method** helps psycholinguists form and test hypotheses about how language works in real time.

### Key Research Goals

Psycholinguists ask questions like:

- What **knowledge** do people have about their language?
- How is that knowledge **used** in speaking, listening, and reading?
- How is language **acquired** by children or second language learners?
- How is language **represented** in the brain?

### Levels of Language

Psycholinguistics investigates language at multiple levels:

| Level         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Phonological  | Sounds and how they’re processed |
| Morphological | Units of meaning and how they combine |
| Syntactic     | Sentence structure and word order |
| Semantic      | Word and sentence meaning |
| Pragmatic     | Meaning in context and interaction |

### Scientific Methods

Common methods include:

- **Reaction time**: How fast people respond to stimuli
- **Eye-tracking**: Where people look while reading/listening
- **Priming**: How one stimulus influences response to another
- **Brain imaging (e.g., fMRI, EEG)**: Where language is processed in the brain
- **Errors and slips**: What mistakes can reveal about planning and memory

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Psycholinguistics** | The study of the mental processes that underlie language use |
| **Competence** | A person’s knowledge of language rules and structures |
| **Performance** | How a person actually uses language in real-life situations |
| **Modularity** | The idea that mental processes operate in specialized, independent units |
| **Reaction Time** | The duration between stimulus presentation and behavioral response |
| **Priming** | When exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🧠 Example: TOT (Tip-of-the-Tongue)

> Think of a time you couldn’t retrieve a word you know. You remember the meaning, maybe the first letter or number of syllables—but can’t say it. What does this tell us about how words are stored?

Use this as a springboard to discuss lexical access and memory.

---

### 🔬 Example: What Makes Language Scientific?

Compare the sentence:

> “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.”  
> 
> It’s grammatical but meaningless. Why?

→ Use this to introduce the distinction between syntax and semantics.

---

### 🎯 In-Class Activities

- **Language Myth Quiz**  
  Debunk statements like “Children learn language by imitation” or “Some languages are more primitive than others.”

- **Pair Work: What Makes Language Special?**  
  Identify properties of language that are unique to humans (e.g., recursion, displacement, arbitrariness).

- **Research Method Match-Up**  
  Students are given method names (eye-tracking, reaction time, etc.) and must match them to the types of questions they can answer.

## 🧩 Practice from the Textbook (Adapted)

> 🧠 Imagine you’re designing a study to test how people understand ambiguous sentences like “The spy saw the cop with the binoculars.”  
> - What methods might you use?
> - What would your hypothesis be?
> - How would you know if your interpretation is correct?

<!-- 
## 🧠 Chapter 1 Lecture Notes: An Introduction to Language Science

Welcome to the first chapter of *Introduction to Psycholinguistics*! This chapter lays the foundation for how we understand language as a mental and cognitive system.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. What Is Psycholinguistics?

Psycholinguistics studies how language is **produced**, **comprehended**, **acquired**, and **represented** in the mind. It draws on fields like psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

> **Example**: When you hear the sentence “The cat sat on the mat,” your brain rapidly decodes sound, retrieves word meanings, and interprets sentence structure — all within seconds.

---

### 2. Hockett’s Design Features of Human Language

Charles Hockett (1960) proposed a set of features that define **human** language and distinguish it from animal communication:

* **Semanticity**: Signals convey meaning (e.g., “help” means someone needs assistance).
* **Arbitrariness**: No inherent link between signal and meaning (e.g., nothing about the word "dog" looks or sounds like an actual dog).
* **Discreteness**: Language is built from distinct units (e.g., phonemes).
* **Displacement**: Ability to talk about things not present (past, future, imaginary).
* **Duality of Patterning**: Sounds combine to form words, words combine into sentences.
* **Generativity**: Infinite sentences from finite rules and vocabulary.

> 🗂️ **Cross-linguistic Note**: All known human languages, including signed languages, share these design features.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll match these features to real examples from English and other languages you speak.

---

### 3. Grammar and the Mental Lexicon

* **Grammar**: The mental system of rules that governs how words combine into sentences.
* **Lexicon**: The mental store of words and their associated meanings, forms, and syntactic properties.

> **Example**: In English, “cat” is a noun, singular, and countable. This information is stored in your mental lexicon.

* **Descriptive Grammar**: Rules based on how language is actually used.
* **Prescriptive Grammar**: Rules taught as “proper usage” (e.g., never end a sentence with a preposition).

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: Descriptive linguistics shows that native speakers often break prescriptive rules while still communicating effectively.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll examine “grammar rules” you’ve learned and test whether native speakers actually follow them.

---

### 4. Animal Communication vs. Human Language

* Apes like **Washoe**, **Kanzi**, and **Nim Chimpsky** have been taught sign or symbol systems.
* These systems can demonstrate **symbolic use**, but lack **recursion**, **generativity**, and consistent **displacement**.

> **Example**: Kanzi could use symbols to request objects, but did not form novel multi-clause utterances.

> 🔁 **Key Debate**: Is recursion (the ability to embed structures within structures) unique to humans? Some argue the **Pirahã language** lacks recursion, challenging claims of universality.

> 🎬 **In class**: We’ll watch a video of Kanzi using lexigrams and complete a comparison table of human vs. non-human communication.

---

### 5. Language and Thought

* **Linguistic Determinism**: Language determines thought. (Strong Whorfian view)
* **Linguistic Relativity**: Language influences perception and memory. (Weak Whorfian view)

> 🧪 **Empirical Evidence**:
>
> * **Color Perception**: Russian speakers distinguish light/dark blues faster than English speakers.
> * **Number Concepts**: Pirahã speakers struggle with quantities beyond 2–3 due to lack of number words.
> * **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Mandarin speakers may interpret counterfactuals differently than English speakers due to language structure.

> 🎨 **In class**: You’ll participate in a short version of the “Russian blues” task and reflect on your own language experience.

---

### 6. The Language Processing System (Preview)

* **Comprehension**: Mapping sounds to meaning — involves speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing.
* **Production**: Mapping meaning to speech — involves conceptual preparation, word retrieval, syntactic planning, articulation.
* **Modularity Debate**: Are these components independent modules, or do they interact dynamically?

> 🧩 **In class**: We’ll build a simple diagram of comprehension and production components as a preview of future chapters.
