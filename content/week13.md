summary: "Explores how children develop grammar, including morphology and syntax, and the mechanisms that support grammatical growth, such as bootstrapping and input sensitivity."

## 📘 Overview

This week focuses on how children develop **morphological** and **syntactic** knowledge in the first few years of life. We will trace the emergence of **inflectional morphology**, **function words**, and **sentence structures**, and examine theories that explain how children achieve such rapid mastery, including **semantic**, **syntactic**, and **prosodic bootstrapping**.

---

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🔠 Morphological Development

- Early speech includes **single-word** utterances → **multi-word combinations**.
- Emergence of **inflectional morphemes** (e.g., -ed, -s) around age 2.
- **Overregularization errors** show internalization of rules:
  > “goed,” “foots,” “breaked”

- These errors are U-shaped:
  - Stage 1: Memorized forms (“went”)
  - Stage 2: Rule-based overgeneralization (“goed”)
  - Stage 3: Correct rule-plus-exception (“went” again)

---

### 📦 Syntactic Development

- Early utterances are **telegraphic**: “Want juice,” “Daddy go work”
- Gradual inclusion of:
  - **Function words** (e.g., determiners, auxiliaries)
  - **Complex structures** (e.g., questions, negation)

- Developmental sequence:
  1. Word combinations (18–24 mo.)
  2. Subject–verb–object (SVO) structure
  3. Negation and questions
  4. Relative clauses, passives (by ~4–5 years)

---

### 🚼 Bootstrapping Theories

- **Semantic bootstrapping**: Children infer syntactic roles from meaning.
- **Syntactic bootstrapping**: Use sentence structure to infer word meaning.
  > e.g., “She daxed the toy” → “dax” is likely a verb
- **Prosodic bootstrapping**: Use rhythm, intonation to detect structure.

---

### 🗣️ Input and Feedback

- Children’s grammatical development depends on:
  - **Quantity** and **quality** of caregiver input
  - **Recasts** and **expansions** (corrective feedback)
  - Exposure to **varied** and **structured** language

---

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🧠 Overregularization Sorting

- Provide examples of child errors: students classify as overregularized, correct, or irregular.

### 🛠️ Sentence Construction Task

- Students build increasingly complex sentences from word cards.
- Reflect on when and how children acquire these structures.

### 🔄 Bootstrapping Debate

- Divide class into groups: semantic vs. syntactic vs. prosodic bootstrapping.
- Each team defends their theory with examples and evidence.

## ❓ Key Questions

1. What are overregularization errors and what do they reveal about grammatical development?
2. How do children acquire function words and syntactic rules?
3. What roles do bootstrapping mechanisms play in grammar learning?
4. How does language input shape syntactic development?

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Overregularization** | Applying grammatical rules to irregular forms (e.g., "goed") |
| **Telegraphic Speech** | Early utterances lacking function words |
| **Function Words** | Words like "the," "is," "can" that serve grammatical purposes |
| **Bootstrapping** | Learning one linguistic system using cues from another |
| **Recasts** | Caregiver reformulations of child utterances |
