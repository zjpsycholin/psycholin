title: "Week 14: Bilingual Minds"
tags: ["bilingualism", "language control", "second language acquisition"]
summary: "Examines how bilingual individuals manage two languages during comprehension and production, the cognitive consequences of bilingualism, and models of bilingual language control."
---

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore how bilinguals process and control their two (or more) languages. We look at how both languages are active during listening and speaking, how interference is managed, and what cognitive advantages might arise from bilingual experience. We also examine individual differences in language learning and the neural basis of bilingualism.

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🌐 Simultaneous Language Activation

- Bilinguals often **activate both languages** during comprehension and production.
- This leads to **competition**, especially when words share meaning or sound.
- Context (e.g., setting, speaker, topic) helps resolve competition.

### 🏗️ Shared vs. Separate Representations

- Bilinguals share **semantic representations**, but may have **distinct phonological** and **orthographic** forms.
- **Shared syntactic structures** suggest deep overlap between languages.

### ⚖️ Language Control Models

- **BIA+ (Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus)**: explains recognition across languages using a layered system.
- **Inhibitory Control Model**: bilinguals suppress the non-target language using cognitive control.

### 🧠 Bilingualism and Executive Function

- Bilinguals show **enhanced cognitive control**:
  - Inhibitory control
  - Task switching
  - Working memory
- Evidence includes **Stroop tasks** and **Simon effect** studies.

### 🎓 Second Language Learning and Variability

- Factors influencing success:
  - **Age of acquisition**
  - **Language similarity**
  - **Motivation**
  - **Exposure and use**
- Teaching methods (e.g., immersion vs. classroom) affect outcomes.

### 🧬 Neural Basis of Bilingualism

- L1 and L2 activate overlapping brain areas.
- **Proficiency** and **age of acquisition** modulate brain patterns.
- Brain adapts with experience, not just innate capacity.

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🧠 Bilingual Stroop Task

- Demo: bilingual students perform Stroop task in both languages.
- Compare reaction times and discuss cognitive flexibility.

### 🗣️ Interference Simulation

- Pair up: one speaks only L1, the other only L2 during a task.
- Reflect on interference, switching, and control.

### 📈 Debate: Is Bilingualism an Advantage?

- One group defends cognitive benefits, another challenges with alternative explanations.
- Use experimental findings to support arguments.
