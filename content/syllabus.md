**Instructor:** Zhang Jun  
**Class Schedule:** Two 45-minute sessions per week  
**Email:** jzhang3@ahu.edu.cn

## 🧠 Course Introduction

Psycholinguistics is the scientific study of how humans acquire, produce, understand, and represent language in the mind. This course introduces foundational theories, research methods, and key findings in the field, offering an integrated view of linguistic knowledge, language development, processing mechanisms, and neural underpinnings. Topics include speech perception, word recognition, sentence parsing, discourse comprehension, bilingualism, non-literal language, and sign language.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will:

- Understand core psycholinguistic concepts and theoretical models.
- Describe major processes involved in language comprehension and production.
- Identify common methods used in psycholinguistic research.
- Critically evaluate experimental evidence and research findings.
- Apply insights from psycholinguistics to real-life language use and cross-linguistic scenarios.

## 📅 Course Schedule

This schedule aligns with the 1st edition of *Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science* by Matthew J. Traxler.

Each week, we meet for **90 minutes**. This course emphasizes **hands-on learning**, **discussion**, and **student projects** over heavy textbook coverage. Readings are kept light (10–25 pages/week) and interactive activities are built into each session.
