summary: "Introduces how pragmatic principles shape interactive communication, including Gricean maxims, common ground, and how speakers adjust to listeners in dialogue."

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore **language use in social contexts**, focusing on how meaning arises through interaction. Unlike monologues or isolated utterances, **dialogue** involves cooperation, shared knowledge, and continuous adjustment between interlocutors. We’ll cover foundational principles such as **Grice’s maxims**, as well as more dynamic notions like **common ground**, **audience design**, and **perspective-taking** in real-time conversation.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Gricean Maxims of Cooperative Communication

According to philosopher H.P. Grice, speakers follow four maxims when they aim to be cooperative:

1. **Quantity** – Be as informative as necessary; no more, no less.
2. **Quality** – Be truthful; do not say what you believe is false.
3. **Relation** – Be relevant.
4. **Manner** – Be clear; avoid ambiguity and obscurity.

> 🧠 Violations of these maxims often trigger **implicatures**—indirect meanings derived by listeners.

### Dialogue Is Interactive

- Dialogue is not just **taking turns** but **jointly constructing meaning**.
- Speakers and listeners **coordinate their actions**, **adjust timing**, and **anticipate responses**.
- The presence of **feedback** (e.g., head nods, “uh-huh”) plays a crucial role in this alignment.

---

### Common Ground

- **Common ground** = shared knowledge between speakers.
- Speakers tailor their messages based on **assumptions about what the listener knows**.
- This helps reduce ambiguity and processing load.

> Example:  
> “You know, the professor from last semester” presumes shared knowledge.

---

### Audience Design

- Speakers often adjust **length**, **detail**, and **clarity** depending on their audience.
- Related to **Theory of Mind**—our ability to model others’ mental states.
- Studies show that speakers consider their listener’s perspective, but **not always accurately or efficiently**.

---

### Egocentric vs. Listener-Oriented Production

- **Egocentric production**: Speakers sometimes overestimate the listener’s knowledge.
- **Listener-oriented production**: Adjustments based on assumptions about listener's needs.

> Real-life examples: Directions to a local vs. a tourist; inside jokes among friends.

---

### Comprehension and Perspective-Taking

- Listeners also work to **adopt the speaker’s viewpoint**.
- Successful comprehension requires **active inferencing** and **constant updating** of mental models.

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🗣️ Gricean Maxim Skits

- Students work in groups to create **short dialogues** where one speaker **violates a maxim**.
- Class guesses which maxim is violated and why.

### 🤝 Common Ground Game

- One student describes an object to another while **avoiding direct naming**.
- Pairs compare strategies and discuss what knowledge was assumed.

### 🔁 Audience Shift Exercise

- Students rewrite a short explanation (e.g., “How to play chess”) for:
  - a 6-year-old
  - a peer
  - a grandparent
- Class reflects on how the explanation changed and why.

1. What are the four Gricean maxims, and how do they contribute to effective communication?
2. How does common ground influence what we say and how we interpret what others say?
3. What is audience design, and how is it related to Theory of Mind?
4. What evidence shows that dialogue is a cooperative, interactive process?

## 🧩 Practice Prompt

> Dialogue:  
> A: “Where’s the salad dressing?”  
> B: “There’s a gas station around the corner.”  
>
> - What maxim is being violated here?
> - What implicature might be inferred?
